simple
a home page and
unconditional login via Spring Boot's OAuth 2.0 configuration properties
automatically redirected to GitHub.

click
adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

logout
adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

twoproviders
adds a second login provider so the user can
choose on the home page which one to use.

customerror
adds an error message for unauthenticated users,
and a custom authentication based on GitHub's API.

All come up with a home page on http://localhost:8080
All require that you have at least a GitHub and a Google
account to log in and view the content.

NÃŸ:
The apps all work on localhost:8080 because they'll use
OAuth 2.0 clients registered with GitHub and Google for that address.

To run them on a different host/port, you'll need to register your apps that way.

There's no danger of leaking your credentials beyond localhost if you use the
default values.

But, be careful what you expose on the Internet; don't put your own app
registrations in public source control.
