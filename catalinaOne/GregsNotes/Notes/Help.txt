A. Custom ThreadPool

The custom ThreadPool class that is referenced in the canonical server.xml 
file is intended to monitor async behavior within the Catalina container.


The server.xml file is located in the usual place: 

   ../apache-tomcat-8.0.15/conf/server.xml 


The custom ThreadPool class is named CatalinaExecutor; it extends StandardThreadExecutor.
Its specialization consists of lifecycle callback/publication methods, which monitor async 
behavior on behalf of the Catalina container.

 
The CatalinaExecutor.java class is built in a separate project; its delivered to the 
Tomcat/Catalina container in a JAR named CatalinaExecutor.jar, which should be installed 
here:

   ../apache-tomcat-8.0.15/lib/CatalinaExecutor.jar


The CatalinaExecutor.java class is referenced in the server.xml file, via this calibration 
construct, the canonical <Executor> element:

   <Executor className="net.greg.examples.CatalinaExecutor"
      ....
   />

            ... ... ...



B. The webapps.jar 

The webapps.jar is an extract of the contents of the original canonical folder:

    ../apache-tomcat-8.0.15/webapps folder  


It is provisional; meant for those days when nothing is going as planned, and
you have deleted everything in the ../apache-tomcat-8.0.15/webapps folder.
 

The webapps.jar file is located here:

   ../apache-tomcat-8.0.15/GregsNotes/Artifacts/webapps.jar


            ... ... ...
