How do I get the forecast?
Forecasts are divided into 2.5km grids. Each NWS office is responsible for a
section of the grid. The API endpoint for the forecast at a specific grid is:

https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{grid X},{grid Y}/forecast
For example: https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/TOP/31,80/forecast

If you do not know the grid that correlates to your location, you can use the
/points endpoint to retrieve the exact grid endpoint by coordinates:

https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}
For example: https://api.weather.gov/points/39.7456,-97.0892

This will return the grid endpoint in the "forecast" property.
Applications may cache the grid for a location to improve latency and reduce
the additional lookup request. This endpoint also tells the application
where to find information for issuing office, observation stations, and zones.
